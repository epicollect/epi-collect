# Contributing to Epi-Collect
First of all, we'd love your contribution! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Giving advice
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

If you're a researcher and would like to contribute by using our data or advising us about data formats, please see our page with information for [Researchers](./RESEARCHERS.md).

## First time?

If it's your first time contributing to a Github project, we've marked some issues with a `good first issue` label. Those tend to be
well isolated and relatively small issues to get started with. In any case, you can always reach out on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/epi-collect/shared_invite/zt-d24uxjzl-7oT5ljZwRc74VMgozPwAqg)
and we'd be happy to help.

## Communication
We use Github to host our code, to track and discuss issues, host our [roadmap](./ROADMAP.md) and accept pull requests.

All other communication happens on our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/epi-collect/shared_invite/zt-d24uxjzl-7oT5ljZwRc74VMgozPwAqg) channel.
If you'd like to contribute, please join and we'd be happy to help you!

## We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Read the [README](./README.md) for instructions on how to set up your development environment. If you have any questions, please reach out on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/epi-collect/shared_invite/zt-d24uxjzl-7oT5ljZwRc74VMgozPwAqg).
2. Add some documentation and make sure you've tested your code.
3. Create a pull request and assign it to either @larsmennen or @nessup. Make sure you include a clear description of the changes and why they are needed / desireable.
4. We will review your PR, merge and deploy!

At the moment, deployments are restricted to core contributors only.

## License
When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the [project](./LICENSE). Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using [Github issues](https://github.com/epicollect/epi-collect/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write detailed bug reports
Good bug reports should include a quick summary of the problem, steps to reproduce the problem, details about your environment and what happens vs. what you expect to happen.
